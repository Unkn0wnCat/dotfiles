# Kevin's Dotfiles

This repo contains my personal dotfiles and configurations for my computers.

## NixOS

I use NixOS as my main OS, and for that I have written a few modules in [`nixos/modules`](./nixos/modules).
Are those settings perfect? No, but they are my opinionated defaults. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

*Build-Command Example:*

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake '.#kevin-tp' --impure
```
